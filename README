=== Install ===

To install your own instance of Scripts Pony, make a symbolic link
from somewhere in your web_scripts directory to here, and make sure
that daemon.scripts can read everything here and write the data
directory.

ln -s "$(pwd)/web_scripts" ~/web_scripts/pony
fsr sa . daemon.scripts read
fsr sa data daemon.scripts write

Pony will try to use your username+scripts-pony database on
sql.mit.edu.  Go to sql.mit.edu and create this database, and
be sure the login info in your ~/.my.conf is accurate.

=== Authentication and Authorization ===

Scripts Pony's LDAP user needs the following ACI on
ou=VirtualHosts,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu in order to make changes in
LDAP:

(version 3.0;acl "pony";allow (add,write) userdn="ldap:///uid=pony.scripts.mit.edu,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu";)

Pony's cert, Private/pony-cert.pem probably needs to be mapped to
allow authentication to the pony user.  To do this, you'll need
something like the following in /etc/dirsrv/config/certmap.conf:

certmap Scripts		C=US, ST=Massachusetts, O=scripts.mit.edu, CN=scripts.mit.edu CA/emailAddress=scripts@mit.edu
Scripts:DNComps		dc
Scripts:FilterComps	cn

This assumes that the certificate's subject looks like:

Subject: C=US, ST=Massachusetts, L=Cambridge, O=scripts.mit.edu, CN=pony.scripts.mit.edu/emailAddress=scripts-pony@mit.edu

And the user in LDAP looks like:

dn: uid=pony.scripts.mit.edu,ou=People,dc=scripts,dc=mit,dc=edu
uid: pony.scripts.mit.edu
cn: pony.scripts.mit.edu
objectClass: account
objectClass: top
