 * Figure out what the right logic is for adding default
   aliases for non-MIT hostnames.
 * Allow vhosts to be deleted if you confirm 17 times.
   * This will require an ACI change.
 * Allow aliases to be manually removed.
   * This may require an ACI change.
 * Check stella info with PyMoira before sending mail for *.mit.edu
   * Package PyMoira into an rpm and get installed on scripts servers
 * When people request or edit a vhost, try to see if we can tell whether
   the path exists.  If we can tell it doesn't exist or that it's not 
   a directory, display a useful warning and make the user confirm that's
   what they want.
 * Semi-automatic mode:
   * allow auth'd zephyrs from people on scripts-team to approve them
     via a zephyrbot.
     * Get PyZephyr working/packaged on scripts.
   * I want to parse jweiss's responses for 
     "done mod DNS", and raise a flag if it looks like they contain actual 
     content.
   * Customizable templates for outgoing mail
 * On error, go back where you were instead of punting to /index
 * Deal with the new vhost reification system, if it starts existing.
 * Possibly give scripts-team more ability to look at/edit arbitrary lockers' 
    vhosts via Pony
 * Let scripts-team members specify the RT ID manually when sudoing, to avoid 
   creating a new ticket.
