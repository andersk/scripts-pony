 * Display aliases, and figure out what the right logic is for adding
   aliases for non-MIT hostnames.
 * Allow aliases to be manually created and removed.
   * This may require an ACI change.
 * Allow vhosts to be deleted if you confirm 17 times.
   * This will require an ACI change.
 * Ask for a description when requesting hostnames, as a social factor.
 * Check stella info with PyMoira before sending mail for *.mit.edu
   * Package PyMoira into an rpm and get installed on scripts servers
 * Semi-automatic mode:
     We have an admin queue.  When a *.mit.edu vhost is requested, an
     email to jweiss is composed and put in the queue; a scripts
     team member can click a button to send it, or edit it in place.
   * Zephyr -c scripts when a new queue entry appears, and allow
     auth'd zephyrs from people on scripts-team to approve them
     via a zephyrbot.
   * I want to use mail scripts to parse jweiss's responses for 
     "done mod DNS", but this doesn't actually do anything useful.
     Though possibly we do want jweiss's responses to go to the pony
     admin queue and not RT.
   * Perodically monitor DNS and notify users (and update the admin queue)
     when their hostnames are live.
 * On error, go back where you were instead of punting to /index
 * Deal with the new vhost reification system, if it starts existing.
